<HW-1 Repo>

##Homework 1
This repo contains code that I refactored  to make an existing webpage's HTML more accessible by improving the element semantics and syntax. I also consolidated and reorganized CSS selectors and properties to allow the CSS to match up well with the HTML. 
I was motivated to complete this code refactoring to better understand writing accessible HTML and CSS. I built this project as practice on writing in HTML and CSS and understanding how to use Gitlab to develop and deploy a webpage. 
This rework solves the problem of the original HTML not being as accessible to screen-readers and web-searches as it could be. It also improved CSS readability by reorganizing the CSS to follow the HMTL positioning in addition to adding comments to explain the CSS selectors.
I learned how to improve webpage readability for HTML and how to consolidate and comment CSS more effectively. 

##Installation
Simply copy the code for this repo from the HW-1 repo on Github.
